## Agenda

- What's the Problem?
- Bitcoin Library: Demo
- Bitcoin Library: Under the Hood
- NIPs used and future development

---

## What's the Problem?

Lots of great educational resources about any kind of topic out there

---

**BUT** we lack a service to collaborativley *collect*, *annotate* and *share* these resources

‚û°Ô∏è to make them *accessible* for teachers and learners

‚ùå **without** building another centralized platform

---

Requirements for educational services (about highly controversial topics):

- decentralized
- censorship-resistant
- Value 4 Value

(V4V Because the content might not be funded from the state or similiar)

---

### Nostr FTW!

- By design decentralized
- Hard to censor
- Affinity to Bitcoin and Lightning facilitates V4V

---

# DEMO

---

### Components of the Bitcoin Library

- Metadata-Editor to annotate web resources (Browser Extension)
- "Note Fetcher" to collect notes and transform them
- Frontend to display and search through resources

---

### Browser Extension

::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
- Simple Metadata Editor
- JSON Schema
- SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)
::::
:::: {.col}

### Metadata Attributes as Nostr Bots

::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
![](../images/select-field.png)
::::
:::: {.col}
- SKOS Concepts (i.e. controlled vocabularies) set up as bots.
- Every selected entry will repost the resource. 
- So you can follow these bots (and later send them resources as well)

### Note Fetcher

- ETL-work
- polls the relay every 5 seconds to retrieve new data
- Either pushes it directly to the index if URL of resource does not exist
- **OR** Merges the metadata with existing metadata in the index

---

### Frontend

![](../images/frontend.png)

---

### Challenge: Differing Metadata Annotations

In a decentralized annotation system, metadata for the same resource will differ sooner or later

How to handle this?

---

- The note fetcher merges the metadata and sets it in proportion with attributes that were already given. The frontend resembles that through opacity of the tags.

 It is not yet an implementation of [(NIP-57)](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md), but we use the LUD16 field of the profiles retrieved via the npub of the actor. Then the payment is made using simple WebLN standard

---

## That's it?

Basically yes.

But you might have noticed:

*There is no data in the code*

---

## Easy to adopt

The usage of JSON Schema and SKOS makes the whole approach easily adaptable.

Want to build a library (community) for recipes?

‚û°Ô∏è Create a JSON Schema for it and some vocabularies and go!

---

### NIPs used

- [NIP-1](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md) 
- [NIP-7](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/07.md) `window.nostr`; Login with Alby
- [NIP-10](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/10.md) to identify the bot in the event
- [NIP-19](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/19.md) so clients can correctly substitute npubs with the nostr actors name (if provided)
- [NIP51](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md#nip-51) for building lists of interesting content (see <https://listr.lol/>)
- [(NIP-57)](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md) retrieving lud16 fields from a provided npub to tip the authors

---

## Future Developments

- go public
- fill with resources
- think about UX for mobile users
- build a community
- add i18n

### Questions / Discussion

Thank you!
